```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This project will show an example correlation analysis on female height and weight from the 'women' data set on R.

***Loading Packages***
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)
library(tidyr)
```

## Creating a data set
For this example of a correlation analysis, we can use the women data set. Here is a preview of the data
```{r}
# Preview data
head(women)
```

After obtaining our data set, we can visually inspect the relationship between the two variables:
```{r}
women %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = height, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_classic()
```
